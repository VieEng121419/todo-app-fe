Welcome to my full-stack learning project! 🚀 This Todo application is where I'm exploring and mastering modern web development technologies. It's not just a todo app - it's my playground for learning everything from frontend React patterns to backend API design.

> **Learning in public by Anh Duong** 📚✨

## 🔗 Related Repositories

This is a **full-stack project** with separate frontend and backend repositories:

- **Frontend (This Repo)**: Modern React/Next.js application
- **Backend**: [todo-app-be-nodejs](https://github.com/VieEng121419/todo-app-be-nodejs) - Node.js API server

Both repositories are part of my complete full-stack learning journey!
